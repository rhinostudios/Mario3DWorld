CEMU Optimisation <br>

<br>

CEMU is a highly experimental emulator for Wii U games <br>

to be used on PC. Started in October 2015, the emulator <br>

has developed huge leaps in CPU and GPU Graphics Accuracy.<br>

Now, as of October 2016, mostly all CPU/GPU functions. <br>

So the past few months up to Christmas has been Optimisation.<br>

<br>

The December 2016 release brings the community of Patreon financial<br>
backers, an almost fully functional application! Hurray ;) <br>
Notable support being Super Mario 3D World, even on Intel GPU's!<br>
<br>
Mirrored here are CEMU, the WUD_Compressor for space saving your<br>
game dumps, usually over 50% compacted!<br>
e.g. SM3DW 26GB reduced to just 2.6GB!<br>
<br>
Please Note: <br>
<br>
DELETE THE SHADER CACHE IF THERE IS SLOWDOWN<br>
<br>
THIS CAN OCCUR IN CEMU BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS<br>
CACHED ONCE FULL SLOWDOWN CAN OCCUR<br>
MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS UPDATE TO LATEST VERSION<br>
